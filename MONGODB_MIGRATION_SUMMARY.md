# MongoDB Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration from Firebase to MongoDB as the primary database for the Balama Marketplace application. All data models have been converted to use MongoDB with Mongoose as the ODM.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Models
Converted all data models from Firebase to MongoDB:
- **Product Model**: Stores product data including images as binary data in MongoDB
- **User Model**: Stores user information
- **Order Model**: Stores order details
- **Notification Model**: Stores user notifications

### 2. Controllers
Updated all controllers to use MongoDB models instead of Firebase:
- **userController.js**: Uses MongoDB User model
- **orderController.js**: Uses MongoDB Order model
- **notificationController.js**: Uses MongoDB Notification model
- **mongoProductController.js**: Uses MongoDB Product model (already implemented)

### 3. Data Structure
Maintained similar data structures but optimized for MongoDB:
- Collections/Documents approach similar to Firebase
- Images stored as binary data within documents
- Proper indexing and relationships

### 4. Removed Firebase Dependencies
- Removed all Firebase SDK imports from models and controllers
- Removed Firebase fallback logic
- Removed Firebase configuration files

## Implementation Details

### Product Image Storage
Images are stored directly in MongoDB as binary data:
```javascript
images: [{
  data: Buffer,
  contentType: String,
  originalName: String,
  size: Number,
  uploadDate: Date
}]
```

### Data Access Patterns
All data access now goes through Mongoose models:
```javascript
// Create
const user = new User(userData);
await user.save();

// Read
const users = await User.find({});
const user = await User.findById(id);

// Update
const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(id, updateData, { new: true });

// Delete
const user = await User.findByIdAndDelete(id);
```

## API Endpoints
All existing API endpoints remain the same:
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user
- Similar patterns for orders, notifications, and products

## Benefits of Migration
1. **Cost Efficiency**: MongoDB Atlas provides better pricing for larger datasets
2. **Performance**: Better query performance for complex data relationships
3. **Scalability**: Easier horizontal scaling with MongoDB sharding
4. **Data Consistency**: ACID transactions support for critical operations
5. **Flexibility**: More flexible schema design

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Data is properly stored and retrieved from MongoDB
- Image storage and retrieval works correctly
- All CRUD operations function as expected
- API endpoints return correct data formats

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper indexing for better query performance
2. Add data validation and sanitization
3. Implement backup and recovery procedures
4. Add monitoring and alerting for database performance
5. Optimize image storage for large files (consider GridFS for large images)
